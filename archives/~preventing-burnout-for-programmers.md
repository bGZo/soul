- It’s not rare in the field of programming to burn out and lose passion for your work
- Burnout seems to occur amongst the programmers more often than professionals in other fields.
- The second reason involves the fact that programming is highly ==cognitively intensive== and stressful job, and the mental ==fatigue can take its toll==.
- ==burnout== is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of ==sacrifice== and or effort into high-risk problems that fail. It’s the result of a negative prediction error in the ==nucleus accumbens==. You effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure.
- Not a day goes by without failures when creating software.
- It has been shown time and time again that productivity, which, in this case, refers to output, decreases sharply after 4 hours of focused work.
- It’s impossible to stay productive at a highly cognitively intensive job such as programming long-term, with a long number of working hours every day.
- Programming is partly engineering and using ==well-proven== techniques for producing software. But it’s also about having fun, experimenting, and trying out new ideas.
- Deliberately dedicating 20% of your time for ==goofing== around with technology is one of the most effective ==strategies== for avoiding burnout.
- Besides, doing something seemingly unrelated to your “actual” work might ==reignite== your passion and ==spark== new ideas
- Don’t ==masturbate== yourself mentally thinking you must work 10 hours/day, 6 days/week.
