## [[logseq]] export

      - I know it is really annoyed 😵. I made [[navigation]] a whole afternoon, I have to open every linked pages, cut them and put it in start page.
      - Then, to beautify and make it more visual-friend, I have to design icon in every title block.
      - Even though I've spent much time to collect bookmark in every topic, I still have to spend much time on other things not matters.
  - ~~Not support block ref~~
