          Creating an IDE for iOS is going to be a challenge. There are three key challenges: 
          1. Having your IDE build and install an entirely new app isn’t really feasible. While it __might__ be feasible to build the app, there’s no supported way for one app to install another. 
          2. Running the code you generate in a subprocess isn’t feasible because iOS does not allow an app to create an arbitrary subprocess. 
          3. Running native code within you app isn’t feasible because third-party apps can’t allocate memory that can be executed.
