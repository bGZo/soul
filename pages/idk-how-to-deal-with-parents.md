- I don't know how to deal relationship with my parents
-
- To be honest, my parents' life is turning down from sometime I don't know. Just think about it, I still remember they're still strong in my childhood. And then they take me to school, I still could see them each night. But really I don't know when their illness symbol is shown, when they feel sake, or even worse. I have no idea.
- Then I go for a middle school, there is almost no time for my parent. And when I found my family is not well as my classmates, I turn into the status that complain them, even though from now my opinion, it's not all their faults, I cannot understand too much deep of the whole thing. So I decide not to deal with my family issues, like a asshole, not to take much time with my family. Therefore, the best excuse of escaping native family is go to the library. With the enough money and it's all JUST FOR THE STUDY!
- - And now is holiday, I live back to the school as the home is kind of noisy. I don't know how to deal with the relationship with my parents, especially I'll go to the Xi'an capital for work in the second half of this year. The time with them is really less. Should I take back to home, rather then here? I don't know how to deal with that.
- As we known, life will be sustainable only if there is hope in future. But when I assume  that my parents is turn to dementia, just like *[The Father](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Father_(2020_film))*, I cannot take it any more. I thought their life is like a food, and now they're turn to the bad very slowly, without sound just like what happened in my childhood, and the worst thing is that, I cannot take them back, back to youth, back to my childhood, and it's really hard right now.
