- ## Story
  - DONE Why Laura is dead? How?
    collapsed:: true
    - **Bob.** Although he's less likely to be the murderer, as he seemed sincerely caring about her, he is the only person to go corrupted up to 3 times 2 of which don't tell what exactly he was doing before going back to normal. What's more, in Theatre he seemed to have memories about her screaming, that could mean him at least seeing her dying. However, TWD seems to contradict the last one. That would also require some time shenanigans which many theorists tend not to accept or another corruption of his that we are unaware of & that feels unlikely.
    - **Laura.** 1st of all, the most realistic scene of her death was in The Cave. She's clearly cut her throat by her own hand. A CS killing her in all the other scenes could be a metaphor symbolizing her depression. We've also seen a blond russian matriochka doll cutting her own throat in Case 23. However, that's quite an uncommon way of suicide, there are many much less painful means to go. That also could mean that she was forced to do that. For example, by CS leaving her body in that scene of The Cave. It probably could possess her in a way William could be possessing the Vanderbooms in Roots (which is also debatable). In that case it's unlikely to be her own CS for it was willing to live again both in Roots & Seasons & that was the ultimate goal for both of the games.
    - **Dale.** The final scene of Paradox (regular endings) once again shows us a CS doing the job. It also appears & disappears in the very same manner a CS did in The Cave: from Laura's behind & back to there. In chapter 2 we discover that this CS was Dale himself. Considering how late the game was released, it could be a big climactic reveal on the dev's behalf. What's more, 2 Dales seeing each other seems to be the paradox that granted the title to the game. Although this game takes place inside Dale's mind it partially reflects the reality. If that's also the case for the final scene, the paradox mentioned above suddenly becomes global & hell important: a corrupted Dale kills Laura so the still living one can start his investigation. However, the knife Dale was using was different from the one in Laura's house, in case you consider that important. What's more, all of that also could be a metaphor of Dale & Laura being unable to coexist due to inevitable sacrifice of one of them for the elixir sake. Although that sacrifice may not necessarily contradict the "global paradox" theory, it's sufficient on its own to justify the situation making the latter unnecessary.

  - DONE Why Bob is arrested?
    collapsed:: true
    - I suppose he found his girl friend have died and he kill himself in the theatre.
    - > Laura breaks up with Bob, he becomes depressed and apathetic, screws up his job getting himself fired, then wastes away at home. Then in the news, he sees Laura is dead. He decides to get drunk and goes to a bar (Theater), where he encounters Dale. Since Bob is wanted as a suspect, Dale calls for backup while following him to a nightclub, where he gets arrested. I'm unsure where to place his suicide. Similar to Van Gogh (which may now finally be relevant), seems like certain individuals, perhaps full of despair, when they commit suicide or die, instead their corrupted soul takes over the body. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not, but he may've killed himself way early on and just continued as a "corrupted zombie" for a while, could even be the real killer of Laura for all we know. His final descent into corruption likely happened at the police office, where he kills the guard. I'm unsure why that didn't land Bob in jail, but perhaps TWD/Mr. Owl pulled some strings to have him transferred to TWD since he clearly wasn't sound of mind, under strict surveillance. The only memory that wouldn't fit this, is the phone call one. It clearly happens after Laura's death (since Sarah brings Bob flowers and lets him know about TWD), but I really doubt the police would take long to go after Bob, and even if they can't prove he killed her, they should definitely jail him for killing the guard, unless corrupted Bob broke out and is on the run, but during that escape he reverted back to his usual self and then oblivious to everything that just happened, calls into TWD where they secretly took him in. (They tell him to wait for a car to pick him, rather than tell him to come).

  - The ending of game
    collapsed:: true
    - 隐藏结局，Alternative，一周目通关后可选择。
      时间依然是1972年8月20日，地点依然是这个纯白的房间，小黑也依然躺在床上不省人事。我们的主角Sarah来到房间用密码FREE登录了自己的用户名，一共三条信息。通过这些来自经理的信息可知，记忆可以通过在睡眠中连接所有物质来提取，而他们的目的就是Bob记忆里的Laura。尽管被再三警告/叮嘱未经允许不得进入患者梦境以及清除患者记忆，Sarah还是用密码打开了衣橱，将方块连接起所有物质，最后打开电视机，删除了其中所有关于Laura的记忆。这一次，梦中的Bob依然在公园里散着步，但长椅上却不再有Laura，于是他继续前行，最终来到一扇白门之前。打开门，可以看到一个彩色的世界，窗边是Sarah搀扶着Bob的背影，一切似乎都在好转。另外，桌子上放着一本写着Bob名字的书，副标题是False Accusations，推测是指被误认为是杀害Laura的嫌疑人一事。而这本书在Cube Escape:Paradox中也有出现。
  - Timeline
    collapsed:: true
    - 在Laura死亡后，Bob先是经历了Cube Escape:Theatre(1971年)，在剧院与来自未来(1972年)的侦探Dale相遇，自杀并腐坏；接着经历了Cube Escape:Case 23(1972年夏)，被当做杀害Laura的嫌疑人被捕，在警局与调查案件的侦探Dale相遇，然后腐坏并杀死了看守他的警察；最后经历了The White Door(1972年8月14-20日)，在大马路上醒来失忆，前往白门接受治疗，并在治疗途中腐坏。且不论他前两次是如何脱离腐坏状态的，第三次明显是早有预谋，白门的目标就是他的记忆，或者说记忆里的Laura。而第三次的腐坏有两种可能，一是白门故意为之，毕竟那几张能破解秘密的图纸是他们自己提供的，这可能是一场实验的必须过程；二是白门的叛徒所为，偷偷调换了娱乐活动的内容，毕竟经理很紧张Bob的记忆，还多次警告工作人员要小心。而在梦的最后Laura留下的话语也很意味深长：It's all in your head.

  - [白门时间线 | TWD Timeline (讨论:The White Door)](https://bgm.tv/subject/topic/24460)
  - I bought this game several years ago when game just released, and I deleted it while I done. Actually, I don't know the ARG activities holden by rusty lake. Maybe I am really not soft for this kind of game. I am absorbed by art first time. Now I want to finish the full achievements and reinstall again, yet I realize I've missed a lot fun of game. The level  of Sarch is more than this game.
