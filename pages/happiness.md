    > In my opinion, the happiness need to be collected.
    快乐需要积攒
    - What some ridiculous reason is, "I'm busy", just like [[the-little-prince]].
    - But I have to say, after going to work, or enter in a big system, the time of our life was broken into pieces. This is fact. So there's must some moments we don't like to live. So we need some place to escape to. So there are.
    - The deeper question is, **How to reach the place faster, then we could have a nice time at least? What's the best moment we have?**
- ## What
  - TODO What moment I feel happiness?
    - Maybe I feel happiness when I first try something, or I've archived some milestones, or I'm just dropped into something I interested in.
