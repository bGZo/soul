- have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens
  - supports passing functions as arguments to other functions
  - returning them as the values from other functions
  - assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures
- There are certain implementation difficulties in passing functions as arguments or returning them as results, especially in the presence of non-local variables introduced in nested and anonymous functions
  - Historically, these were termed the **funarg problems**, the name coming from "function argument"
- ## Concepts
  - Higher-order functions: passing functions as arguments
  - Anonymous and nested functions
  - Non-local variables and closures | 非局部变量和闭包
  - Higher-order functions: returning functions as results
  - Assigning functions to variables
  - Equality of functions
    - Extensional equality | 外延相等
    - Intensional equality | 内涵相等
    - Reference equality | 引用相等
