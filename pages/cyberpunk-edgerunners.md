- We are not **Special**
  collapsed:: true
- 最具讽刺 (irony) 意味的是: David 害怕接收自己并不普通的事实, 然后这个成为了它驱使自己进一步成为 赛博疯子(lose himself -> cyber psychosis) 的压力, 因为他认为自己不普通, 他认为他必须往前走, 因为只有他擅长这个, David 努力地帮身边的人实现了他们的梦想, 他们的生活就不会什么都不是, 他的生命也不会什么都不是. 尽管实现的方式不会让人开心, David 想证明自己的价值, 证明 David 很特别, 尽管他真的不特别
  collapsed:: true
  - 我们都可以共情的一点是, 我们都会害怕无意义的工作消磨我们的能力, 或是追逐某些失败了的梦想
- 就像作者最后说的: 放下你为自己设计的包袱, 活到当下, 寻找到你自己, 你不必非要做什么, 你并不特别, 某种程度上来说, 我们都一样
  > you're not destined for anything. you're not special because in a way we all are.

      > One of the most essential aspects of Edgerunners that people don't quite get is that it is a **classic Greek Tragedy**. Every character has a fatal flaw, and each and every one of them are the architects of their own downfall. David, Lucy, Rebecca, Kiwi, Maine, Faraday. Their choices are what cement their own fates, and the consequences of their own actions are what ultimately condemn them. There may be no happy endings in Night City, but in the end, they have no one to blame but themselves.

    - >The best part about this anime and the Cyberpunk universe as a whole?Nobody is safe, everything is unfair, and hope for better tomorrow is a very short lived commodity.
      You either leave the city to find a new way of life, or you will be forced to become a part of its fcked up system and die at some point.
      Scariest part is, the way we are going right now, it could easily become our world, and we are actually not that far from it.
    - >David ultimately served as a cautionary tale for those wise enough not to be blinded by the empty promises and lies of night city. Get out while you can.
      I had a similar experience after graduating uni, I moved to Stockholm to pursue my dreams and make a career, but the entire city was low-vibrational. The metros, everyone was running and being stressed out. People mistake the crowds of people and the things constantly happening in big cities as "full of life" when it actually is just stress. I ended up moving back to my home town working at a 9-5 blue collar job, because it was a lot less responsibility and a lot less stress. The people here are more down to earth and value the feeling of community and family. My younger self would never understand the decision I made to come home. Because I was blinded by the illusion of becoming a rap legend and a corporate prodigy. In the end I realized, majority of folks don't give a crap about you and those that do care about your legend do not care about you, they care about your legend. And they seek to thwart you.
      So if anyone stuck in a similar spot, to me this decision that I made got me feeling like (spoooooooilerssssssss) I chose the panam ending of cyberpunk. I got out while I still could. I placed the value of family and true friendship as the meaning for wealth, not pursuing some status quo or selling out my ideals, my values for the sake of appeasing corporate values and fitting in with people I do not share anything in common with.
      This is the rat race. When you have to fake to get ahead in order to get a better day tomorrow. However this is the illusion, when you have everything then you will understand the value of having nothing. What I mean by this is that when you have everything, money, power, fame, you end up with nothing since you have sold out your values, anything that made you, you. In the end you become a hollow shell walking in the shadow of your former self, either resulting in doubling down with what you are or having to find back to who you are.
      Never give away who you are, this is the only thing in this third dimensional world that not even the universe can take away from you.
      Do what you do best, keep fighting.
