        collapsed:: true
        - server:
          collapsed:: true
          - always-on host
          - permanent IP address
          - often in data centers, for scaling (拓展)
        - clients:
          collapsed:: true
          - contact, communicate with server
          - may be intermittently(间歇地) connected
          - may have dynamic IP addresses
          - do not communicate directly with each other
          - examples: HTTP, IMAP, FTP
      - Peer-peer architecture
        collapsed:: true
        - no always-on server
        - arbitrary end systems directly communicate
        - peers request service from other peers, provide service in return to other peers
          collapsed:: true
          - self scalability – new peers bring new service capacity, as well as new service demands
        - peers are intermittently connected and change IP addresses
        - complex management
        - example: P2P file sharing

        collapsed:: true
        - process sends/receives messages to/from its socket
        - socket analogous to door
          collapsed:: true
          - sending process shoves message out door
          - sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process
          - two sockets involved: one on each side
        - ((643f9efe-3522-4325-b637-9dac3903a191))
      - Addressing processes
        collapsed:: true
        - to receive messages, process  must have identifier
        - host device has unique 32-bit IP address
          collapsed:: true
          - Q: does IP address of host on which process runs suffice for identifying the process?
          - A: no, many processes can be running on same host
        - identifier includes both IP address and port numbers associated with process on host.
        - example port numbers:
          collapsed:: true
          - HTTP server: 80
            mail server: 25

            1b. HTTP server at host www.someSchool.edu waiting for TCP connection at port 80  “accepts” connection, notifying client
          - 2. HTTP client sends HTTP request message (containing URL) into TCP connection socket. Message indicates that client wants object someDepartment/home.index
          - 3. HTTP server receives request message, forms response message containing requested object, and sends message into its socket
          - 4. HTTP server closes TCP connection.
          - 5. HTTP client receives response message containing html file, displays html.  Parsing html file, finds 10 referenced jpeg  objects

          - OS overhead (开销) for each TCP connection
          - browsers often open multiple parallel TCP connections to fetch referenced objects in parallel
        - Persistent HTTP (HTTP1.1):
          collapsed:: true
          - server leaves connection open after sending response
          - subsequent (后来的) HTTP messages between same client/server sent over open connection

              从机构路由器到服务器的RTT
            - $delay_{access-link}$ 是公网延时
          - Solution
            collapsed:: true
            - Option 1: buy a faster access link
            - Option 2: install a web cache (cheaper and better)
        - Conditional GET
          collapsed:: true
          - Goal: don’t send object if cache has up-to-date cached version
          - no object transmission delay (or use of network resources)
          - client: specify date of cached copy in HTTP request
            collapsed:: true
            - If-modified-since: <date>
          - server: response contains no object if cached copy is up-to-date: `HTTP/1.0 304 Not Modified`
      - HTTP/2
        collapsed:: true
        - Key goal: decreased delay in multi-object HTTP requests
          collapsed:: true
          - HTTP1.1: introduced multiple, pipelined GETs over single TCP connection
            collapsed:: true
            - server responds in-order (FCFS: first-come-first-served scheduling) to GET requests
            - with FCFS, small object may have to wait for transmission  (head-of-line (HOL) blocking) behind large object(s)
            - loss recovery (retransmitting lost TCP segments) stalls object transmission
        - HTTP/2: [RFC 7540, 2015] increased flexibility at server in sending objects to client:
          collapsed:: true
          - methods, status codes, most header fields unchanged from HTTP 1.1
          - transmission order of requested objects based on client-specified object priority (not necessarily FCFS)
          - ==`push unrequested objects to client`==
          - ==`divide objects into frames, schedule frames to mitigate HOL blocking`==
        - HTTP/2 mitigating HOL(Head of Line) blocking 
          collapsed:: true
          HTTP 2 减少队头阻塞
          - HTTP 1.1: client requests 1 large object (e.g., video file) and 3 smaller objects
            collapsed:: true
            - objects delivered in order requested: O2, O3, O4 wait behind O1
          - HTTP/2: objects divided into frames, frame transmission interleaved (交错)
            collapsed:: true
            - O2, O3, O4 delivered quickly, O1 slightly delayed
      - HTTP/2 to HTTP/3
        collapsed:: true
        - HTTP/2 over single TCP connection means:
          collapsed:: true
          - recovery from packet loss still stalls(拖慢) all object transmissions
            collapsed:: true
            - as in HTTP 1.1, browsers have incentive(奖励) to open multiple parallel TCP connections to reduce stalling, increase overall throughput
          - no security over vanilla TCP connection
          - HTTP/3: adds security, per object error- and congestion-control (more pipelining) over UDP
            collapsed:: true
            HTTP/3：增加了安全性，每个对象的错误和拥堵控制（更多的管道），超过UDP
            - more on HTTP/3 in transport layer

            - SMTP: client push
            - both have ASCII command/response interaction, status codes
            - HTTP: each object encapsulated in its own response message
            - SMTP: multiple objects sent in multipart message
            - SMTP uses persistent connections

          - complexity at network’s “edge”
      - DNS: services, structure

          - mail server aliasing
          - load distribution

        - Q: Why not centralize DNS?
          - single point of failure (单点故障)
          - traffic volume
          - distant centralized database

        - Client wants IP address for www.amazon.com; 1st approximation:
          - client queries root server to find .com DNS server
          - client queries .com DNS server to get amazon.com DNS server
          - client queries amazon.com DNS server to get IP address for www.amazon.com
      - DNS: root name servers
      - Top-Level Domain, and authoritative servers
        - Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers:
          - responsible for .com, .org, .net, .edu, .aero, .jobs, .museums, and all top-level country domains, e.g.: .cn, .uk, .fr, .ca, .jp
          - Network Solutions: authoritative registry for .com, .net TLD
          - Educause: .edu TLD
        - authoritative DNS servers:
          - organization’s own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization’s named hosts
          - can be maintained by organization or service provider
      - Local DNS name servers
        - when host makes DNS query, it is sent to its local DNS server
          - Local DNS server returns reply, answering:
            - from its local cache of recent name-to-address translation pairs (possibly out of date!)
            - forwarding request into DNS hierarchy for resolution
              each ISP has local DNS name server; to find yours:
              - ```shell
                # MacOS 
                scutil --dns
                # Windows
                ipconfig /all
                ```
        - local DNS server doesn’t strictly belong to hierarchy
      - DNS name resolution
        - Iterated(迭代) query:
          - contacted server replies with name of server to contact
          - “I don’t know this name, but ask this server”

      - Caching DNS Information
        - once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches mapping, and immediately returns a cached mapping in response to a query
          - caching improves response time
          - cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time (TTL)
          - TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
        - cached entries may be out-of-date
          - if named host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire!
          - best-effort(尽力而为) name-to-address translation!
      - DNS records
        - DNS: distributed database storing resource records (RR)
          - $$(Name, Value, Type, TTL)$$
        - type=A
          - name is hostname
          - value is IP address

          - name is alias name for some “canonical” (the real) name
            www.ibm.com is really servereast.backup2.ibm.com
          - value is canonical name

        - challenge:  scale(规模) - how to reach ~1B users?
        - challenge: heterogeneity(异质性)
          - different users have different capabilities (e.g., wired versus mobile; bandwidth rich versus bandwidth poor)
        - solution: distributed, application-level infrastructure
      - Multimedia: video
        - video: sequence of images displayed at constant rate
          - e.g., 24 images/sec
        - digital image: array of pixels
          - each pixel represented by bits
        - coding: use redundancy(冗余性) within and between images to decrease # bits used to encode image
          - spatial (within image)
            空间性
          - temporal (from one image to next)
            时间性
        - CBR: (constant bit rate): video encoding rate fixed
        - VBR:  (variable bit rate): video encoding rate changes as amount of spatial, temporal coding changes
        - examples:
          - MPEG 1 (CD-ROM) 1.5 Mbps
          - MPEG2 (DVD) 3-6 Mbps
          - MPEG4 (often used in Internet,  64Kbps – 12 Mbps)
      - Streaming stored video
        - Main challenges in simple scenario:
          - server-to-client **bandwidth** will vary over time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, access network, network core, video server)
          - **packet loss, delay** due to congestion will delay playout, or result in poor video quality
        - ![POWERPNT_431.png](../assets/POWERPNT_431_1682068477119_0.png)
        - playout buffering
          - ![POWERPNT_432.png](../assets/POWERPNT_432_1682068525541_0.png)
          - client-side buffering and playout delay
            - compensate(补偿) for network-added delay, delay jitter(抖动)
      - Streaming multimedia: DASH (Dynamic, Adaptive Streaming over HTTP)
        - server:
          - divides video file into multiple chunks
          - each chunk encoded at multiple different rates
          - different rate encodings stored in different files
          - files replicated in various CDN nodes
          - manifest file: provides URLs for different chunks
        - client:
          - periodically(定期) estimates server-to-client bandwidth
          - consulting manifest, requests one chunk at a time
            - chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
            - can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time), and from different servers
        - “intelligence” at client: client determines
          - when to request chunk (so that buffer starvation(饥饿), or overflow does not occur)
          - what encoding rate to request (higher quality when more bandwidth available)
          - where to request chunk (can request from URL server that is “close”(靠近) to client or has high available bandwidth)
      - Content distribution networks (CDNs)
        - challenge: how to stream content (selected from millions of videos) to hundreds of thousands of simultaneous users?
        - ~~option 1: single, large “mega-server”~~ (doesn’t scale)
          collapsed:: true
          - single point of failure
            point of network congestion
            long (and possibly congested) path to distant clients
        - option 2: store/serve multiple copies of videos at multiple geographically distributed sites (CDN)
          - enter deep: push CDN servers deep into many access networks
            - close to users
            - Akamai: 240,000 servers deployed in > 120 countries (2015)
          - bring home: smaller number (10’s) of larger clusters in POPs near access nets
            - used by Limelight
        - CDN: stores copies of content (e.g. MADMEN) at CDN nodes
        - subscriber requests content, service provider returns manifest
          - using manifest, client retrieves content at highest supportable rate
          - may choose different rate or copy if network path congested
          - ((64425378-5d93-4cb9-b5f4-977b165178d6))
