        - socket analogous to door
          collapsed:: true
          - sending process shoves message out door
          - sending process relies on transport infrastructure on other side of door to deliver message to socket at receiving process
          - two sockets involved: one on each side

      - Addressing processes
        collapsed:: true

          - Q: does IP address of host on which process runs suffice for identifying the process?
          - A: no, many processes can be running on same host
        - identifier includes both IP address and port numbers associated with process on host.

            - Option 1: buy a faster access link

          collapsed:: true
          - Goal: don‚Äôt send object if cache has up-to-date cached version

            - with FCFS, small object may have to wait for transmission  (head-of-line (HOL) blocking) behind large object(s)
            - loss recovery (retransmitting lost TCP segments) stalls object transmission
        - HTTP/2: [RFC 7540, 2015] increased flexibility at server in sending objects to client:
          collapsed:: true
          - methods, status codes, most header fields unchanged from HTTP 1.1

          - client queries .com DNS server to get amazon.com DNS server
          - client queries amazon.com DNS server to get IP address for www.amazon.com
      - DNS: root name servers
      - Top-Level Domain, and authoritative servers
        - Top-Level Domain (TLD) servers:
          - responsible for .com, .org, .net, .edu, .aero, .jobs, .museums, and all top-level country domains, e.g.: .cn, .uk, .fr, .ca, .jp
          - Network Solutions: authoritative registry for .com, .net TLD

        - authoritative DNS servers:
          - organization‚Äôs own DNS server(s), providing authoritative hostname to IP mappings for organization‚Äôs named hosts
          - can be maintained by organization or service provider
      - Local DNS name servers
        - when host makes DNS query, it is sent to its local DNS server
          - Local DNS server returns reply, answering:
            - from its local cache of recent name-to-address translation pairs (possibly out of date!)
            - forwarding request into DNS hierarchy for resolution
              each ISP has local DNS name server; to find yours:

      - Caching DNS Information
        - once (any) name server learns mapping, it caches mapping, and immediately returns a cached mapping in response to a query
          - caching improves response time
          - cache entries timeout (disappear) after some time (TTL)
          - TLD servers typically cached in local name servers
        - cached entries may be out-of-date
          - if named host changes IP address, may not be known Internet-wide until all TTLs expire!

      - Streaming stored video
        - Main challenges in simple scenario:
          - server-to-client **bandwidth** will vary over time, with changing network congestion levels (in house, access network, network core, video server)
          - **packet loss, delay** due to congestion will delay playout, or result in poor video quality

            - chooses maximum coding rate sustainable given current bandwidth
            - can choose different coding rates at different points in time (depending on available bandwidth at time), and from different servers
        - ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù at client: client determines
          - when to request chunk (so that buffer starvation(È••È•ø), or overflow does not occur)

          - where to request chunk (can request from URL server that is ‚Äúclose‚Äù(Èù†Ëøë) to client or has high available bandwidth)

        - CDN: stores copies of content (e.g. MADMEN) at CDN nodes
