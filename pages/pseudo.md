    collapsed:: true
    - ```
      Extract the next word from the line (good)
      set word to get next token (poor)
      Append the file extension to the name (good)
      name = name + extension (poor)
      FOR all the characters in the name (good)
      FOR character = first to last (ok)
      ```
  - 描述分解到单层循环或决策的地步
    - ```
      [X] Search the list and find the customer with highest balance
      ```
  - 伪码因人而异, 没有详尽的符号, 因为供人阅读(!=机器)
  - Specific Structured Programming Constructs
    collapsed:: true
    特定结构化编程组件(6) -- 逻辑/算法控制流
    - SEQUENCE
      - a linear progression where one task is performed sequentially after another
      - Several keywords
        - Input: READ, OBTAIN, GET
        - Output: PRINT, DISPLAY, SHOW
        - Compute: COMPUTE, CALCULATE, DETERMINE
        - Initialize: SET, INIT
        - Add one: INCREMENT, BUMP
      - ```
        Brush teeth
        Wash face
        Comb hair
        Smile in mirror
        ```
    - WHILE
      collapsed:: true
      - a loop (repetition) with a simple conditional test at its beginning.
      - ```
        WHILE employee.type NOT EQUAL manager AND personCount < numEmployees
          INCREMENT personCount
          CALL employeeList.getPerson with personCount RETURNING employee
        ENDWHILE
        ```
    - IF-THEN-ELSE
      collapsed:: true
      - a decision (selection) in which a choice is made between two alternative courses of action.
      - ```
        IF HoursWorked > NormalMax THEN
          Display overtime message
        ELSE
          Display regular time message
        ENDIF
        ```
    - (flow of control)
      ---
      (need more)
    - REPEAT-UNTIL
      - a loop with a simple conditional test at the bottom
    - FOR
      collapsed:: true
      - a "counting" loop
      - ```
        FOR each month of the year (good)
        FOR month = 1 to 12 (ok)
        FOR each employee in the list (good)
        FOR empno = 1 to listsize (ok)
        ```
    - CASE
      collapsed:: true
      - a multiway branch (decision) based on the value of an expression. CASE is a generalization of IF-THEN-ELSE.
      - ```
        CASE  Title  OF
          Mr      : Print "Mister"
          Mrs     : Print "Missus"
          Miss    : Print "Miss"
          Ms      : Print "Mizz"
          Dr      : Print "Doctor"
        ENDCASE
        ```
  - NESTED **CONSTRUCTS**
    collapsed:: true
    嵌套结构
    - 组件可以彼此嵌套, 使用缩进(indented)区隔
    - ```
      SET total to zero
      REPEAT
        READ Temperature
        IF Temperature > Freezing THEN
            INCREMENT total
        END IF
      UNTIL Temperature < zero
      Print total
      ```
  - INVOKING SUBPROCEDURES
    collapsed:: true
    调用子过程
    - ```
      CALL AvgAge with StudentAges
      CALL Swap with CurrentItem and TargetItem
      CALL Account.debit with CheckAmount
      CALL getBalance RETURNING aBalance
      CALL SquareRoot with orbitHeight RETURNING nominalOrbit
      ```
  - EXCEPETION HANDLING
    collapsed:: true
    - ```
      BEGIN
        statements
      EXCEPTION
        WHEN exception type
            statements to handle exception
          WHEN another exception type
              statements to handle exception
      END
      ```
