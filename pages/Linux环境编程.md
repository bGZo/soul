- ## Q&A
  - [[posix]] vs [[-nix]]
    - POSIX(Portable Operating System Interface)  is a family of __standards__ specified by the IEEE Computer Society for maintaining compatibility between operating systems.
    - After 1997, the Austin Group developed the POSIX revisions. The specifications are known under the name Single UNIX Specification, before they become a POSIX standard when formally approved by the ISO. (via: [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX))
  - VFS
    - VFS（Virtual File System）是Linux内核里提供文件系统接口给用户态应用程序的一个虚拟文件系统层。同时VFS还提供了抽象化的操作接口以方便实现内核的底层文件系统. (via: [cnblog](https://www.cnblogs.com/jimbo17/p/10107318.html))
