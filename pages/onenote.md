  - [10:00] I know that the OneNote that iPad scan is basically the same as the desktop version and I also know that that's because Apple forces developers to publish their products specially for the device they want to target whereas with Android the app itself is the one that has to adopt to the device, it's being used on and there are  a lot of Android devices, but still I think that there's plenty of room for improvement and there has been a lot of people complaining about this along the years...
