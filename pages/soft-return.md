- [What is a Soft Return?](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/softretu.htm)
  - A **soft break**, **soft return**, or **soft enter** is a carriage return automatically inserted by the [software](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/s/software.htm) program, usually because of a [word wrap](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/w/wordwrap.htm). Soft returns allow you to continue typing without having to press Enter (may also be labeled as Return) manually at the end of each line or margin. The picture shows soft returns with [formatting marks](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/f/formmark.htm) enabled. The soft return symbol is an arrow point down and to the left, like the arrow seen on many [Enter or Return keys](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/e/enterkey.htm).
