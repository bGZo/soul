    - 343.There is no denying that you can never be too careful in dealing with this matter.
      - can never be too (much)... 意为“再……也不过分” (**从来不会太多，再多也不算多**)
        collapsed:: true
        - 当我们说 "can never be too..." 的时候，其中每个单词的含义和作用如下：

        - "Never": 这个词表示永远不会，即无论什么时候都不会发生或不会出现。
        - "Be": 这个词表示状态或者存在，即这个事情是一种状态或者存在的情况。
        - "Too": 这个词表示过分或者太多，即这个事情达到某种程度之后就会变得过分或者不合适。
        - 因此，"can never be too..." 的整体意思是，某个事情无论达到多少程度都不会过分或者不合适，而且这种情况将永远不会改变。
        - > 我可不可以理解中间省略的一个“much”？
        - 在 "can never be too..." 这个短语中，通常可以在 "too" 后面添加 "much"，变成 "can never be too much"，表示某个事情无论达到多么大的程度都不会过分或者不合适。例如，“You can never have too much love”（你对爱的需求永远不会太多）。
