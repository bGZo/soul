- ## Why
  - Before this, I used the [[vivaldi]], [[Firefox]], [[chrome]], [[brave]] and [[chromium]]. I learn a lot about  thought during using. (See  ((acaf8742-7083-4d0d-adc9-eaebc5a30b26)))

    - The longest I used is firefox and vivaldi. The former I begin to use in high school, but the performance of high usage is not as good as the chrome. So I changed to chrome, which is really faster and feeling good.
    - But the auto updater is annoying. So I deleted its updater software. And that's okey.
    - Then I was dropped by the panels by vivaldi. I really think what bookmark should be like this. So I changed.
    - Then one day, I used [[wacom]] to browse web, then I found they're not support the default operation of chromium. They're only compatible with the mouse, instead of the tablet. So I changed again.
    - I changed to the brave, which is used my roommate. And I found they're based on [[chromium]], so they don't have the GMS. So they couldn't receive the message after closing tabs. So I changed to chromium.
    - Then [[chatGPT]], [[bing AI]] and Google Bard is released, which is not support in other browser except the edge browser.
    - I used it a lot. Then I found their PDF reader, voice reader, and more additions with windows OS is powerful then chromium. So I changed it. And the [[Privacy]] is really dangerous, which I am really afraid of. I should notice a lot in the future.
