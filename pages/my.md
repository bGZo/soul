  - 👋 I'm **bGZo**, look like privacy-first name, right?
  - My actual name is *Fenghua*, you could call me _**Hua**_ 🌸.
  - I love open-source, command-line, creating tools to improve productivity. Recently I focus on Java develop. So any problem welcome to communicate with me.
  - Except above, I love coffee, reading (philosophy, non-fiction most), anime, podcast and instrumental music as well. If you're, wish we could be friends : )
  - I'm engineer, but I love literature.
