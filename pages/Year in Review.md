    - [[狗熊有话说]] [ep. 400](https://voice.beartalking.com/400) 讲 [@Tim Ferriss](https://tim.blog/2021/12/27/past-year-review/) 的方法: **不要着急做做新一年的计划, 而是去回看过去一年的经历**. 以及以下的方法论:
    - > 1. Grab a notepad and create two columns: POSITIVE and NEGATIVE.
      2. Go through your calendar from the last year, looking at every week.
      3. For each week, jot down on the pad any people or activities or commitments that triggered peak positive or negative emotions for that month. Put them in their respective columns.
      4. Once you’ve gone through the past year, look at your notepad list and ask, “What 20% of each column produced the most reliable or powerful peaks?”
      5. Based on the answers, take your “positive” leaders and schedule more of them in the new year. Get them on the calendar now! Book things with friends and prepay for activities/events/commitments that you know work. It’s not real until it’s in the calendar. That’s step one. Step two is to take your “negative” leaders, put “NOT-TO-DO LIST” at the top, and put them somewhere you can see them each morning for the first few weeks of 2022. These are the people and things you *know* make you miserable, so don’t put them on your calendar out of obligation, guilt, FOMO, or other nonsense.
    - 我根据这个规则做了一些模板，供参考：
      template:: year/review/with/feedback
      template-including-parent:: false
      - | 正反馈的事情 | 负反馈的事情 |
        | ---------| ---------|
        |  |  |
      - 最值得你花时间去做的事情：
        - logseq.order-list-type:: number
      - 千万不要花时间 / 尽量不要花时间去做的事情：
        - logseq.order-list-type:: number
