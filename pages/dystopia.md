  - > In English, the term "dystopia" is used to describe a society or community that is oppressive, controlled, or unpleasant, especially one that is imagined or projected into the future. Dystopias are often characterized by poverty, suffering, and lack of individual freedom.
    Examples of dystopias in literature and media include George Orwell's "1984," Aldous Huxley's "Brave New World," and the "Hunger Games" series.
    The opposite of a dystopia is a utopia, which is a society or community that is perfect or ideal in some way.
    So in English, the term "anti-utopia" or "anti-dystopia" can be used to describe something that is opposed to or critical of the idea of a utopian society.
